        When I was 12 years old , I realized that the world of kids is boring. Especially at my age. We passed the point where we would entertain ourselves. No longer is it an age where you can goof off by yourself, or an age where it's appropriate to go out and explore new fun by yourself. So all of us got deeply involved in 4399.

        4399 was the best choice in those days. A huge gaming page with tons of computer games. Let's start the pending countdown at the end of the last afternoon session.

        The two-player games in there drove me and my friends crazy. There was only one computer at home. So my friends and I made a tacit agreement. Enable one life per person. Often there were a bunch of kids sitting around waiting for their turn.

        It's an indelible part of childhood.
